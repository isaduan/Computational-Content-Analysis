      "</p>, <p><b>Content analysis</b> is the study of <a href=\"/wiki/Document\" title=\"Document\">documents</a> and communication artifacts, which might be texts of various formats, pictures, audio or video. Social scientists use content analysis to examine patterns in communication in a replicable and systematic manner.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> One of the key advantages of using content analysis to analyse social phenomena is its non-invasive nature, in contrast to simulating social experiences or collecting survey answers.\n",
      "</p>, <p>Practices and philosophies of content analysis vary between academic disciplines. They all involve systematic reading or observation of <a href=\"/wiki/Text_(literary_theory)\" title=\"Text (literary theory)\">texts</a> or artifacts which are <a href=\"/wiki/Coding_(social_sciences)\" title=\"Coding (social sciences)\">assigned labels (sometimes called codes)</a> to indicate the presence of interesting, <a href=\"/wiki/Semantics\" title=\"Semantics\">meaningful</a> pieces of content.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Tipaldo_2014_42_3-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Tipaldo_2014_42-3\">[3]</a></sup> By systematically labeling the content of a set of <a href=\"/wiki/Text_(literary_theory)\" title=\"Text (literary theory)\">texts</a>, researchers can analyse patterns of content <a href=\"/wiki/Quantitative_research\" title=\"Quantitative research\">quantitatively</a> using <a href=\"/wiki/Statistics\" title=\"Statistics\">statistical methods</a>, or use <a href=\"/wiki/Qualitative_research\" title=\"Qualitative research\">qualitative</a> methods to analyse meanings of content within <a href=\"/wiki/Text_(literary_theory)\" title=\"Text (literary theory)\">texts</a>.\n",
      "</p>, <p>Computers are increasingly used in content analysis to automate the labeling (or coding) of documents. Simple computational techniques can provide descriptive data such as word frequencies and document lengths. <a href=\"/wiki/Machine_learning\" title=\"Machine learning\">Machine learning</a> classifiers can greatly increase the number of texts that can be labeled, but the scientific utility of doing so is a matter of debate. Further, numerous computer-aided text analysis (CATA) computer programs are available that analyze text for pre-determined linguistic, semantic, and psychological characteristics.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Neuendorf2016_4-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Neuendorf2016-4\">[4]</a></sup>\n",
      "</p>, <p>Content analysis is best understood as a broad family of techniques. Effective researchers choose techniques that best help them answer their substantive questions. That said, according to <a href=\"/wiki/Klaus_Krippendorff\" title=\"Klaus Krippendorff\">Klaus Krippendorff</a>, six questions must be addressed in every content analysis:<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Krippendorff2004_5-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Krippendorff2004-5\">[5]</a></sup>\n",
      "</p>, <p>The simplest and most objective form of content analysis considers unambiguous characteristics of the text such as <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Word_frequencies\" title=\"Word frequencies\">word frequencies</a>, the page area taken by a newspaper column, or the duration of a <a href=\"/wiki/Radio\" title=\"Radio\">radio</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Television\" title=\"Television\">television</a> program. Analysis of simple word frequencies is limited because the meaning of a word depends on surrounding text.  <a href=\"/wiki/Key_Word_in_Context\" title=\"Key Word in Context\">Key Word In Context</a> (KWIC) routines address this by placing words in their textual context. This helps resolve ambiguities such as those introduced by <a href=\"/wiki/Synonym\" title=\"Synonym\">synonyms</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Homonym\" title=\"Homonym\">homonyms</a>.\n",
      "</p>, <p>A further step in analysis is the distinction between dictionary-based (quantitative) approaches and qualitative approaches. Dictionary-based approaches set up a list of categories derived from the frequency list of words and control the distribution of words and their respective categories over the texts. While methods in quantitative content analysis in this way transform observations of found categories into quantitative statistical data, the qualitative content analysis focuses more on the intentionality and its implications. There are strong parallels between qualitative content analysis and <a href=\"/wiki/Thematic_analysis\" title=\"Thematic analysis\">thematic analysis</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup>\n",
      "</p>, <p>Quantitative content analysis highlights frequency counts and objective analysis of these coded frequencies.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-:03_7-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:03-7\">[7]</a></sup> Additionally, quantitative content analysis begins with a framed hypothesis with coding decided on before the analysis begins. These coding categories are strictly relevant to the researcher's hypothesis. Quantitative analysis also takes a deductive approach.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-:12_8-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:12-8\">[8]</a></sup>\n",
      "</p>, <p><a href=\"/wiki/Siegfried_Kracauer\" title=\"Siegfried Kracauer\">Siegfried Kracauer</a> provides a critique of quantitative analysis, asserting that it oversimplifies complex communications in order to be more reliable. On the other hand, qualitative analysis deals with the intricacies of latent interpretations, whereas quantitative has a focus on manifest meanings. He also acknowledges an \"overlap\" of qualitative and quantitative content analysis.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-:03_7-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:03-7\">[7]</a></sup> Patterns are looked at more closely in qualitative analysis, and based on the latent meanings that the researcher may find, the course of the research could be changed. It is inductive and begins with open research questions, as opposed to a hypothesis.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-:12_8-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:12-8\">[8]</a></sup>\n",

    "I will analyze the transcripts of US House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology's Congressional Hearings from 2001 to 2021 to learn about the policy-making process on technology and sciences in democracies. The social game is a game of sense-making: how policymakers make sense of policy challenges of increasing complexity, how they manage \"surprises\" and \"uncertainty,\" how they absorb new information, and how they develop - or perhaps reject - new imageries and ideas. The actors are US policy elites, including House Representatives and subject experts invited to tesitify. "

    "## ***Why?***\n",
    "I want to make inferences about the social game of policymaking regarding technology and science in the US. Thus, my population of interests is American policy elites on the subject matter. There are two merits of this research design. First, my proposed sample can expose the dynamic, interactive process where policy elites construct or contest a shared perception towards technologies and sciences. Previously, those micro-interaction cannot be observed and analyzed at large 'historical' scale. Second, my research design can uncover policymaking in its natural setting relatively free from self-report bias that usually undermines interview and survey data. However, my sampling also has two limitations. To ensure the the consistency of my sample over time, as I plan to draw cross-time comparision of the policymaking process, I decide to restrict my sample to only the House Committee. But the making of technology policy does not only take place in the House Committee where I will collect data from; discussions also happen in Senate, executive office, and 'off records'. Second, my data are texts; they necessarily miss out other parts of micro interaction such as face and body expressions, sound tone, thus potentially biasing my inference about the process in a 'flat' way. One way to scale my project is to draw comparision across different policy areas (e.g. collect data from other committees), draw comparision across other branches of governments (e.g. courts, executives), draw comparision between policy hearings and broader public/media discourse, and draw cross-nation comparision (e.g. with EU, UK, non-democracies).
